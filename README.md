## Thaliak's Translations: v1.0

This is an app which will allow its users to practice translation from one natural language to another, utilizing the official languages for Final Fantasy XIV Online (FFXIV).

You can [access it here](https://thaliak.herokuapp.com/)!

### Current Features

For the initial version of this app, I have utilized the official Japanese, English, German, and French texts of FFXIV to allow a user to practice translating between any two.

On the initial view, the user will see a selection of Japanese text from a FFXIV quest. Above that, they are presented with two drop-down menus with which to choose between languages. They are also provided a text box in which to place their translation.

After clicking the provided button (initially labeled as "Show EN"), the user will be presented with the official English (or other language as chosen) version of the same text in the bottom box. The user will then be able to compare their version of translation with the official versions, and therefore be able to find their own mistakes and learn new translation techniques.

### Warning

I wish to caution everyone who may use this app that translation is NOT an exact science! The exact content of the official languages' text is often very different; the official text should be used as guidelines and learning tools. The user should not strive to predict what the official text says, but instead should create their own version based on what they are shown for source text.

In addition, this app is far from complete!

At times you may see text display such as "<Sheet(EventItem,20000950,0)/>" in either selection of official text. This is merely placeholder text used by the game. However, if you use the app and find these, please submit a bug report with the offending text so I can fix it.

At other times, you will get a piece of text that has far too little context on its own to be given a translation, typically a single word or sound that a character is producing. I haven't yet decided on a solution for this, and suggestions are welcome.

### Future

While there are still things to be done on this project, I am currently putting it aside to work on other projects. I will return to this project from time to time in order to provide enhancements and bug fixes. If you wish to see what I have planned for the future, you can check out my [Issues](https://github.com/TouRyuu/thaliak-xltn/issues) or the [Project Board](https://github.com/TouRyuu/thaliak-xltn/projects/2).
