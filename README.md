## Thaliak Translations

This is an app which will allow its users to practice translation from one natural language to another, utilizing the official languages & translations for Final Fantasy XIV Online (FFXIV).

### Planned Features: V1.0

For the initial version of this app, I have utilized the original Japanese text and the English translation of FFXIV to allow a user to practice translating from Japanese to English.

On the initial view, the user will see a selection of Japanese text from a FFXIV quest, and be provided a text box in which to place their translation.

After clicking the provided button (labeled as "Show EN"), the user will be presented with the official English version of the same text in the bottom box. The user will then be able to compare all three versions of the text, and therefore be able to find their own mistakes and learn new translation techniques.

### Warning

I wish to caution everyone who may use this app that translation is NOT an exact science! The exact content of the official languages' text is often very different; the official text should be used as guidelines and learning tools. The user should not strive to predict what the official text says, but instead should create their own version based on what they are shown for source text.

In addition, this app is far from complete!

At times you may see text display such as "<Sheet(EventItem,20000950,0)/>" in either selection of official text. This is merely placeholder text used by the game, and I still need to make those locations look nicer.

At other times, you will get a piece of text that has far too little context on its own to be given a translation, typically a single word or sound that a character is producing. I haven't yet decided on a solution for this and suggestions are welcome.
