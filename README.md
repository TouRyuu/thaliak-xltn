## Thaliak Translations

This is an app which will allow its users to practice translation from one natural language to another, utilizing the official languages & translations for Final Fantasy XIV Online (FFXIV).

It is currently still in early development, and as of v0.1.0, does not actually do anything.

### Planned Features: V1.0

For the initial version of this app, I intend to utilize the original Japanese text and the English translation of FFXIV to allow a user to practice translating from Japanese to English.

On the initial view, the user will see a selection of Japanese text from a FFXIV quest, and be provided a text box in which to place their translation.

After clicking the provided button (currently labeled as "Show EN"), the user will also be presented with the official English version of the same text. The user will then be able to compare all three versions of the text, and therefore be able to find their own mistakes and learn new translation techniques.

### Warning

I wish to caution everyone who may use this app that translation is NOT an exact science! The exact content of the official languages' text is often very different; the official text should be used as guidelines and learning tools. The user should not strive to predict what the official text says, but instead should create their own version based on what they are shown for source text.
